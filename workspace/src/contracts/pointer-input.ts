/**
 * Pointer coordinate boundary types for Ocean Rescue (WP-32B).
 *
 * This module is the single type-only authority for the normalized pointer
 * boundary shared by the canonical ESM lane and the legacy ordered-script
 * lane:
 *
 * - browser client coordinates -> Ocean Rescue logical coordinates
 * - travel pointer event -> logical stage Y
 * - rescue pointer event -> logical `{ x, y }`
 * - the normalized `{ active, x, y }` pointer intent delivered to authored
 *   scenes
 * - the minimal RenderRuntime coordinate-mapper API (`isReady` +
 *   `mapClientToLogical`) that the pointer boundary depends on.
 *
 * The module emits no runtime JavaScript: every export is a type. It must
 * never appear as a runtime module in the production bundle. Only the
 * coordinate-mapping subset of the renderer is typed here; the full
 * RenderRuntime API and the Pixi display-object model are explicitly out of
 * scope.
